<h1>Libft</h1>
The purpose of this project is creating my own library of simple C functions.
<h2>Overview</h2>
The mandatory part of Libft consisting of custom functions that replicate the functionality of standard libc functions.
These functions serve as essential tools for the projects of 42cursus and provides valuable experience in developing and utilizing custom libraries.
After completing the mandatory part, programmers gain access to a set of functions offering additional feautures to expand their skills.
Specifically, the bonus part focuses on the manipulation of lists and using structures.
